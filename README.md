I struggled this module quite a bit. My main struggle was with the profit change.
I also used this code to help to make sure I was on the right track on other parts of the code. 

# PyPoll

As mention above, I sturggled with this module.  I was able to find the total votes but could not get the 
candiates and their votes to print.  I am turning in what I could I do.
