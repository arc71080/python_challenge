I struggled with this module quite a bit. My main struggle was with the profit change.
I also used this code to help ensure I was on the right track on other parts of the code. 

# PyPoll

As mentioned above, I struggled with this module.  I could find the total votes but could not get the 
candidates and their votes to print.  I am turning in what I can do.
