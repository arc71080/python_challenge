I struggled with this module. My main struggle was with the profit change but I also had
to use this code to help ensure I was on the right track for other parts of the code.

# PyPoll

As mentioned above, I struggled with this module.  I could find the total votes but could not get the 
candidates and their votes to print.  I am turning in what I was able to complete.
